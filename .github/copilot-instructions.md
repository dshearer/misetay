# Instructions for Coding Agents

This is Smidja. See [README.md](../README.md) for a description of the project.

Before committing any work to Git, run the tests with `npm run test`. Do not commit
if there are any failures!

When making changes, look for places that can be tested with unit tests, and make
unit tests as appropriate.

This project uses [OpenSpec specs](../openspec) to document requirements. Treat them
as the source of truth about how Smidja should behave.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT make tests that are stupid! They need to test real code -- not mock code!
